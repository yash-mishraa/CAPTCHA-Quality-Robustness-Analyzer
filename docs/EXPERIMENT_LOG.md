# Experiment Log

**Status:** `EXP-0001` completed. No other experiments have been run.

This file is the authoritative record of experiments. An experiment is logged
only if it can be reproduced from the recorded configuration, dataset version,
split, and code revision.

## How to use this log

1. Copy the template into the **Entries** section, newest first.
2. Assign the next sequential ID: `EXP-0001`, `EXP-0002`, ...
3. Record the exact code revision (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`) and note whether
   the working tree was clean.
4. Link the config path and the dataset/split identifiers; do not paste large
   tables here. Generated outputs belong under `reports/` (Git-ignored).
5. Record negative, failed, and inconclusive runs. Mark them as such.
6. Never edit a closed entry to "improve" a result. Supersede it with a new ID
   and cross-reference the correction.

### EXP-0001 — Reference-metric validation pilot (SSIM, PSNR, blur, noise)

- **Date:** 2026-10-20
- **Status:** `completed`
- **Task:** `target-validation`
- **Hypothesis / question:** Do SSIM and PSNR respond predictably and consistently
  to increasing severity of Gaussian blur and additive Gaussian noise, with
  adjacent severities distinguishable and the response stable across fonts and
  seeds? This is a metric-validation experiment, not a human-solvability study.
- **Code revision:** base `d0e5256` plus the Milestone 1 implementation; this
  entry and that implementation are committed together in
  `feat: validate synthetic image quality targets`. Working tree: clean at run.
- **Environment:** CPython 3.13.16; NumPy 2.5.4; pandas 3.0.6; Pillow 12.3.0;
  scikit-image 0.26.0; SciPy 1.18.1; macOS 26 (arm64). OpenCV was installed via
  the `image` extra but is not used by this pilot.
- **Configuration:** `configs/pilot_target_validation.toml`, sha256
  `6e9bdf961f36bbf70f5806e41b53661e1577bf15e13eb833348632359b886715`.
  Thresholds were fixed in the config and in `docs/METHODOLOGY.md` §3.4 **before**
  the recorded run and were not edited afterwards.
- **Dataset:** synthetic, generated in-process; no stored image collection. The
  Git-ignored `reports/pilot/` directory holds tables and contact sheets only.
- **Split:** not applicable (descriptive validation; no model is trained).
- **Seeds:** run seed `20261020`; repeat seeds `[0, 1, 2]`, each an independent
  render-jitter and noise realisation.
- **Runtime:** 0.82 s wall-clock for the full run (324 unique image contents).

**Method.** Rendered 5-character strings (charset `23456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTUVWXYZ`,
ambiguous glyphs removed) at 192x64 px, using 4x supersampling with LANCZOS
downsampling and seeded per-character vertical jitter. Three system fonts
(Arial, Courier New, Times New Roman) x 4 texts each x 3 repeat seeds = **36 clean
reference images** (12 unique strings). Each clean image was scored against:

- itself (36 clean self-comparisons), and
- each severity of two families, reusing the byte-identical reference:
  Gaussian blur radius `[0, 1, 2, 3.5, 5]` px and additive Gaussian noise sigma
  `[0, 6, 12, 20, 32]` on the 0-255 scale, with an independent noise draw per
  `(trial, severity)`.

That yields **360 corrupted-pair rows** at 5 severity levels (severity 0 is the
identity baseline), plus 36 sanity rows. SSIM used `data_range=255`,
`win_size=11`, Gaussian weights (`sigma=1.5`), no sample-covariance correction.
PSNR used `data_range=255`; identical images return `math.inf` explicitly.
MS-SSIM was not evaluated (see limitations).

**Metric summaries.**

Level means (n = 36 per cell; SD in parentheses):

| Family | Metric | s0 | s1 | s2 | s3 | s4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| blur | SSIM | 1.000 | 0.913 (0.009) | 0.712 (0.021) | 0.530 (0.025) | 0.469 (0.043) |
| noise | SSIM | 1.000 | 0.918 (0.007) | 0.781 (0.019) | 0.645 (0.027) | 0.529 (0.033) |
| blur | PSNR (dB) | +inf | 20.663 (0.670) | 15.577 (0.428) | 12.963 (0.449) | 11.955 (0.661) |
| noise | PSNR (dB) | +inf | 35.142 (0.070) | 29.219 (0.077) | 24.813 (0.107) | 20.760 (0.079) |

Spearman rho (severity vs. score, n = 180): blur/SSIM **-0.973**, blur/PSNR
**-0.946**, noise/SSIM **-0.983**, noise/PSNR **-0.968**.

Adjacent-level paired differences and effect sizes (same clean reference; `d` is
paired Cohen's d):

| Family / metric | s0->s1 | s1->s2 | s2->s3 | s3->s4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| blur / SSIM | -0.087 (d=-9.89) | -0.201 (d=-14.89) | -0.183 (d=-5.59) | -0.061 (d=-2.80) |
| noise / SSIM | -0.082 (d=-11.77) | -0.137 (d=-11.28) | -0.136 (d=-13.03) | -0.116 (d=-15.27) |
| blur / PSNR | not evaluable (+inf baseline) | -5.086 dB (d=-15.44) | -2.614 dB (d=-4.16) | -1.008 dB (d=-3.67) |
| noise / PSNR | not evaluable (+inf baseline) | -5.923 dB (d=-57.51) | -4.406 dB (d=-29.27) | -4.053 dB (d=-30.75) |

Trial-level violation rate was **0.000** for every evaluable adjacent pair in both
families and both metrics. Eta squared (severity share of finite-score variance):
blur/SSIM 0.987, noise/SSIM 0.986, blur/PSNR 0.974, noise/PSNR 1.000. Level-mean
ranges: 0.531 SSIM, 0.471 SSIM, 8.708 dB, 14.382 dB respectively.

Per-font rho ranged over [-0.984, -0.979] (SSIM) and [-0.968, -0.964] (PSNR);
per-seed rho over [-0.984, -0.983] (noise/SSIM), [-0.974, -0.972] (blur/SSIM),
and [-0.968, -0.946] (PSNR). Every font and seed group had strictly decreasing
level means.

Strongest within-level correlation with ink coverage (`|r|`, signed value and
level): blur/SSIM 0.874 (-0.874 at s4), noise/SSIM 0.735 (+0.735 at s4),
blur/PSNR **0.975** (-0.975 at s4), noise/PSNR 0.139 (+0.139 at s4).

**Gate results** (predeclared rule, `docs/METHODOLOGY.md` §3.4):

| Family | Metric | Verdict | Failing criterion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gaussian_blur | ssim | **PASS** | — |
| gaussian_blur | psnr | **FAIL** | `non_degeneracy` (`|r_ink|` 0.975 > 0.95) |
| gaussian_noise | ssim | **PASS** | — |
| gaussian_noise | psnr | **PASS** | — |
| any | ms_ssim | **DEFERRED** | no lightweight implementation available without PyTorch |

All four combinations passed direction, aggregate trend, adjacent separation,
violation rate, cross-font/cross-seed stability, and clean-reference sanity
(36/36 exact SSIM=1.0, PSNR=+inf, byte-identical; severity-0 identity rows exact).

**Observations.** The response is smooth and near-monotone for all four
combinations. No trial-level reversals occurred at these ladder spacings. The
clean baseline is exactly perfect for both metrics. Two behaviours are worth
recording:

1. **PSNR under blur is largely an ink-coverage measure at fixed severity.**
   Within the highest blur level, PSNR correlates -0.975 with the clean image's
   ink fraction: images with more ink (e.g. Arial, 0.150 coverage) lose more
   edge area than sparse ones (Courier New, 0.089). SSIM shows the same direction
   at a lower magnitude (-0.874).
2. **The noise ladder is compressed by 8-bit clipping.** Realised noise standard
   deviations were 4.10, 8.08, 13.39, and 21.31 for nominal sigma 6, 12, 20, 32;
   44-46% of pixels hit a rail (mostly the white background). This is why
   measured PSNR exceeds the naive `20 log10(255/sigma)` values, and it matters
   for interpreting absolute severity.

No threshold was changed after inspecting these results.

**Conclusion.** SSIM is a suitable candidate primary target for both families
under the tested conditions. PSNR is suitable for additive noise but not for
blur as a standalone target, because at fixed blur severity it mostly restates
how much ink the image contains. MS-SSIM remains unevaluated. These findings
concern synthetic image similarity only; they say nothing about human
readability or CAPTCHA solvability.

**Limitations.**

- One canvas size, one text length, three fonts, two corruption families, and
  36 source images. Results may not transfer to other renderer settings.
- SSIM and PSNR are full-reference proxies for degradation, not perceptual or
  human-legibility measures.
- Geometric warps, occlusion, and compression are not tested; PSNR's geometric
  sensitivity is therefore not characterised here.
- PSNR's `+inf` clean level is excluded from finite aggregates by design, so the
  s0->s1 PSNR separation could not be quantified with the paired statistic
  (the level means still show the drop).
- Within-level ink coverage explains a substantial share of variance at high
  severity even for SSIM (0.874 at the strongest blur), so font/coverage
  confounding must be tracked in later modelling.
- MS-SSIM deferred: scikit-image provides no MS-SSIM and the maintained
  implementations require PyTorch, which is not installed in this milestone.
- Single-machine run on macOS with system fonts; font binaries and versions are
  recorded by path, not by content hash.

**Next step.** Proceed to Milestone 2 with SSIM as the primary reference target
and PSNR as a secondary diagnostic (noise-family comparisons only). When the
feature pipeline exists, re-run the full non-degeneracy check including
trivial-feature predictability, and add coverage-stratified reporting to track
the ink confound. Revisit MS-SSIM when PyTorch is installed for the CNN work.

**Artifacts.** Git-ignored: `reports/pilot/summary.md`, `gate_results.json`,
`trials.csv`, `sanity.csv`, `levels.csv`, `separation.csv`, `stability` tables,
`ink.csv`, `variance.csv`, and `examples_gaussian_{blur,noise}.png`.
